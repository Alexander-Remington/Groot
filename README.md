* **New Members Roles :**
  * New members will be automatically assigned the selected roles.

* **Message of the Day**
  * **Groot** will send in chat, and the message interval is customizable. 
    This is useful for recurring announcements or reminders.
    
 * **Custom API Keys**
   * Many of **Groot** commands (e.g. `image`, `youtube`, etc.) rely on APIs to fetch data from online sources. 
   Our global API key is rate limited and we often exceed the limit. 
   You can set your own API keys here to avoid being rate limited because people on other servers used certain commands.
   
 * **Status Messages**
   * These status messages will be sent whenever **something changes** on the server. 
   They are divided into three categories: server 
   (name changed, new icon, region switched), members (new member, username changed, etc.), and messages (edited and deleted).
   
 * **Member Ranks**
   * Ranks **classify members by activity** in both voice and text chat. 
   Each rank you add will have a maximum activity score for members to have that rank before they receive the next-highest rank.
   Activity scores are calculated with this formula: `no. messages + minutes active on voice`. You can also set ranks to automatically
   assign a role on the server.
   
 * **Groot Points**
   * Points work much like **karma** on Reddit, but can be disabled per-server and there's no downvoting. 
   You can get Groot Pointsby being upvoted or gilded, winning the lottery, 
   or being one of the top 5 most active members on the server each week. Learn more on the `wiki`.
   
 * **Extensions**
   * Extensions! With extensions, you can write custom addons for Groot-bot on your server, 
   including **commands, keyword responses**, and extensions that run on a **timer** or **event**. 
   Extensions are written in **JavaScript** and run in a sandbox with access to the Groot-bot Code API. 
   Read the docs.
   Extensions can either be local or public.
   **Local** extensions are extensions exclusive to your server, 
   all **Server Admins** can edit the extension and it cannot be installed by other servers or published to the **gallery**.
   **Public** extensions are extensions that can be published to the gallery. 
   Only the extension author can edit their own extensions. Once published, public extensions can be installed by any server.
   
* **Strikes**
  * Strikes are the best way for moderators to **keep track of rule violations** by members on your server. 
  You can add strikes when a user does something wrong, and strikes are automatically added for filter violations. 
  **It is impossible to strike Bot Admins**.
  
* **Filters**
  * Groot-bot provides **filters** for **spam, excessive member/role mentions, NSFW content**, and **custom words**. 
  You can change which channels the filters work in, what happens to violators, and the role (if any) they are assigned. Bot Admins
  bypass these filters.
  
* **Roles**
  * There are a few super-useful commands in **Groot** to manage roles 
  and their permissions on your server -they are listed below. 
  You'll love being able to use these commands to manage roles without having to use the annoying mobile client.
  
* **RSS Feeds**
  * These **RSS feeds can be accessed via the** `rss` **command** by their unique name. 
  For feeds that have streaming enabled, new articles will be posted in the channel you choose every 15 minutes or so. 
  In general, RSS feeds can be used as a means to pull content from a variety of **online services** for which 
  there is no built-in Groot command.
  
* **Streamers**
  * Discord is a gamer-focused platform, so a lot of Discord servers have corresponding stream accounts on **Twitch** and **YouTube** Gaming.
  Groot-bot supports checking for when streams go live (add them below) and has a corresponding `streamers` command 
  to display information about the status of a stream.
  
* **Auto-Translate Messages**
  * Groot `translate` command can be set to automatically **translate messages from certain members to English**. 
  This is useful for users that don't speak English. 
  The bot will **automatically and instantaneously** post a translated version of each message in the channels you specify.
